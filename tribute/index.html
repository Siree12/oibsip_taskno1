            <h2>Gandhiji's role in India's struggle for independence</h2>
            <p>
                The journey of India's struggle for Independence would be totally differnt in the abscence of Mahatma
                Gandhi.<br>
                The first thing that he had done on the advice of Gopal Krishna Gokule considered as his guru was
                analysing the exact
                situation in India.<br> He visited many places in India to understand the ground reality.
                <br>In 1916, he came across the plight of Indigo cultivation in champaran that is exploaitation of
                farmers,
                the debt cycle, etc.,
                <br>Later in 1917, the first civil disobidience movement often referred as Champaran Satyagraha was his
                first success in India.
                <br>With the success, he had raised his voice against Rowlatt act, a non-cooperation movement from
                1920-1922
                unfortunalately called off due to chauri chaura incident.
                <br>Later, Civil disobidience movement and quit India movement were the major ones.
                <br>The idea of individual Satyagraha created a massive movement.
